# Layout Instructions

The current HTML and visual layout of the project is intentionally fixed.

- Do **not** modify `index.html`, `styles.css`, or any structural markup/layout files unless a user explicitly requests a change.
- The layout includes the overlay, game canvas, and control buttons exactly as arranged.

Preserve this layout in all future updates unless directed otherwise.
